##notes on installation and configuration of the variant assessment process

#virtual machines
novel-assess.dipr.partners.org
pcpgm.dipr.partners.org
alamut-ht1.dipr.partners.org


#production code put by direct copy of directory SVN/ngs/NVA to 
	/pcpgm/Tools/code on VMs
	
	
#cronjob set up to run va_exec.py (whole process) 
	and va_dirtree.py (directory creation and file transfer)
	

##setting up virtual machine from fresh build

#ssh keys
ssh: need to ssh to alamut vm once to create entry of host into known_hosts ssh file

#python-devel (python development headers and libs)
	sudo rpm -Uvf python-devel-2.6.6-51.el6.x86_64.rpm

#python libs (sudo easy_install)
pyyaml
paramiko: easy_install http://ftp.dlitz.net/pub/dlitz/crypto/pycrypto/pycrypto-2.1.0.tar.gz
suds
xlwt

	
#Oracle
install instant client and python lib cx_Oracle
	all necessary files and a little instruction 
	in SVN/ngs/bioinfo/People/Jason/build/cx_oracle_install.tar.gz

LD_LIBRARY_PATH has to be set in .bashrc if running from va_exec.py directly 
	(alternative is running sh script nva_run.sh which sets up environment)
	export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/usr/lib/oracle/11.2/client64/lib
